# 📚 My First JavaScript Project

> A pure **Frontend project** built only with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, using **LocalStorage** for data persistence.  
> Developed during my web development training — just **two months after starting my journey** in programming.

## 🎯 Project Context

- 🗓️ Timeline: 3 weeks (3 × 3h per week)  
- 👨‍🎓 Training exercise with **no assistance from the teacher**  
- 💻 Technologies: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- 💾 Storage: **LocalStorage only** (⚠️ no security, no backend)  
- 📝 Final grade: **17/20**

This project was a huge milestone in my learning path. Even though it lacked a real backend and secure storage, it allowed me to deeply understand how **state, logic, and persistence** could work in the browser.
